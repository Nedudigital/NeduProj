MERN Stack Admin Dashboard Project
Welcome to the MERN Stack Admin Dashboard Project! This project showcases the development of a comprehensive admin dashboard using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The dashboard is designed to provide a feature-rich interface for a wide range of applications, including e-commerce platforms, content management systems, and data analysis tools.

The project emphasizes practical use of key frontend and backend technologies, including Material UI, Material UI Data Grid, Nivo Charts, Redux Toolkit, Redux Toolkit Query, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. We will also delve into the intricacies of data modeling with Entity Relationship Diagrams and aggregate calls in MongoDB.
